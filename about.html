<p>Thanks for visiting my blog! I'm a software engineer with a background in classical singing seeking new opportunities in the Greater Boston Area. I've been coding for a little over a year now, and in September I graduated from the Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering Bootcamp. While I'm conducting my job search, I'll be posting weekly about various topics related to programming and the tech industry, from my personal reflections on the job process to explanations of interesting linguistic issues I encounter as I continue to develop my skills. Feel free to check out some of my work over at my Github: https://github.com/ethansagin. My tech stack is primarily Ruby and JavaScript-based, though I have a strong interest in digging into Python at some in the near future!</p>
